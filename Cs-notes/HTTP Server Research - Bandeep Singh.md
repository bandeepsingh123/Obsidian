## ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 1: Discovery & Planning - Task 1**

### ðŸ“‹ **Task Overview**

**Objective:** Research and understand the HTTP protocol fundamentals **Business Context:** Before building any server, professional developers always understand the protocol they're implementing **Industry Standard:** Never code without understanding requirements

### ðŸ”§ **Your Assignment**

Research and document the following (create a simple text file):

1. **Basic HTTP Request Structure:**
    - What are the key components of an HTTP request?
    - What does a simple GET request look like?
2. **Basic HTTP Response Structure:**
    - What are the key components of an HTTP response?
    - What are the most common HTTP status codes?
3. **HTTPS vs HTTP:**
    - What's the difference?
    - Why do we need HTTPS?
4. **Static File Serving:**
    - What does it mean to "serve static files"?
    - What happens when someone requests `index.html`?

### âœ… **Definition of Done**

- A text document with clear, simple explanations of each concept
- At least 2 examples of HTTP requests/responses
- Basic understanding of why HTTPS matters

### ðŸŽ¯ **Professional Skills**

This teaches you **requirements analysis** - a critical skill where you understand what you're building before you build it.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours of research **Resources:** MDN Web Docs, RFC 7230 (HTTP/1.1 basics)

**Submit your research document when ready, and I'll review it like a senior developer would review a design doc!**
