## ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 1: Discovery & Planning - Task 1**

### ðŸ“‹ **Task Overview**

**Objective:** Research and understand the HTTP protocol fundamentals **Business Context:** Before building any server, professional developers always understand the protocol they're implementing **Industry Standard:** Never code without understanding requirements

### ðŸ”§ **Your Assignment**

Research and document the following (create a simple text file):

1. **Basic HTTP Request Structure:**
    - What are the key components of an HTTP request?
    - What does a simple GET request look like?
2. **Basic HTTP Response Structure:**
    - What are the key components of an HTTP response?
    - What are the most common HTTP status codes?
3. **HTTPS vs HTTP:**
    - What's the difference?
    - Why do we need HTTPS?
4. **Static File Serving:**
    - What does it mean to "serve static files"?
    - What happens when someone requests `index.html`?

### âœ… **Definition of Done**

- A text document with clear, simple explanations of each concept
- At least 2 examples of HTTP requests/responses
- Basic understanding of why HTTPS matters

### ðŸŽ¯ **Professional Skills**

This teaches you **requirements analysis** - a critical skill where you understand what you're building before you build it.

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours of research **Resources:** MDN Web Docs, RFC 7230 (HTTP/1.1 basics)

**Submit your research document when ready, and I'll review it like a senior developer would review a design doc!**

HTTP Server Research - [Your Name]
Date: [Today's Date]

=== 1. BASIC HTTP REQUEST STRUCTURE ===

Key Components:
- Request Method (GET, POST, etc.)
- URL/Path
- HTTP Version
- Headers
- Body (optional)

Example GET Request:
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html

=== 2. BASIC HTTP RESPONSE STRUCTURE ===

Key Components:
- Status Line (HTTP version + status code)
- Headers
- Body (the actual content)

Example Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1234

<html>
<body>Hello World!</body>
</html>

=== 3. HTTPS VS HTTP ===

HTTP:
- Plain text communication
- Port 80
- Can be intercepted/read by anyone

HTTPS:
- Encrypted communication using TLS/SSL
- Port 443
- Secure from eavesdropping

Why HTTPS matters:
- Protects user data
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Required by modern browsers for many features

=== 4. STATIC FILE SERVING ===

What it means:
- Server reads files from disk (like index.html, style.css)
- Sends file contents back to browser
- No dynamic processing/generation

Example flow:
1. Browser requests: GET /index.html
2. Server finds index.html file on disk
3. Server reads file contents
4. Server sends back contents with proper headers

=== QUESTIONS/CONFUSIONS ===
- Still unclear about: [mention anything confusing]
- Want to learn more about: [areas of interest]
