**Absolutely!** üéØ Using LLMs for research is actually a **smart professional practice** - but let me teach you how to do it the right way.

## ‚úÖ **Smart Research Strategy**

### **Primary Sources (Best):**

- **Official documentation** (MDN Web Docs, RFCs)
- **Technical books** and tutorials
- **LLMs for clarification** and examples

### **LLM Usage - Professional Guidelines:**

**‚úÖ Good Uses:**

- "Explain HTTP request structure in simple terms"
- "Give me an example of a GET request with headers"
- "What's the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?"
- "Help me understand this concept: [paste confusing text]"

**‚ùå Avoid:**

- Copy-pasting entire LLM responses without understanding
- Using LLM as your only source
- Not verifying critical information

## üéØ **Recommended Approach:**

1. **Start with LLM** to get basic understanding
2. **Cross-reference** with official docs (MDN, etc.)
3. **Write in your own words** - this proves you understand
4. **Ask follow-up questions** to the LLM if confused
