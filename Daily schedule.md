## Real Industry Intensity
### **Professional Developer Schedule:**

- **8-10 hours per day** of focused development work
- **5-6 days per week** (some weekend work during sprints)
- **Total: 40-60 hours per week**
- **Real deadlines with real consequences**

### **Daily Structure (Industry Standard):**

**9:00 AM - 12:00 PM:** Deep work block

- Complex feature implementation
- Architecture decisions
- Problem-solving on hard issues

**12:00 PM - 1:00 PM:** Break/Lunch

**1:00 PM - 4:00 PM:** Implementation block

- Coding, testing, debugging
- Code reviews and refactoring

**4:00 PM - 4:15 PM:** Break

**4:15 PM - 6:00 PM:** Polish & Planning

- Documentation, testing
- Planning next day's work
- Research for upcoming features

**Evening (Optional 2-3 hours):**

- Learning new concepts
- Debugging complex issues
- Prep work for next day

## âš¡ **Aggressive Timeline (3 weeks)**

**Week 1 (7 days):** Foundation to Basic HTTP Server **Week 2 (7 days):** TLS Integration + Advanced Features  
**Week 3 (7 days):** Production Polish + Deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ **This Week's Sprint Goals:**

**Day 1 (Today):** Complete research + start basic TCP server **Day 2:** Working TCP server with basic HTTP parsing **Day 3:** Static file serving functionality **Day 4:** HTTP headers and status codes **Day 5:** Error handling and basic logging **Day 6:** Code review, refactoring, documentation **Day 7:** Sprint review and Week 2 planning

## ðŸ’¼ **Real-World Expectations:**

**Daily standups:** I'll check your progress every day **Code reviews:** Every major feature gets reviewed **Blockers:** When stuck, ask immediately (like real teams) **Quality standards:** Production-ready code, no shortcuts **Documentation:** Everything documented as you build

## ðŸš¨ **Industry Reality Check:**

**This is intense** - you'll experience:

- Mental fatigue (normal)
- Complex debugging sessions (expected)
- Moments of frustration (part of the job)
- Breakthrough moments (the reward)

**But you'll also experience:**

- Rapid skill development
- Real confidence in systems programming
- Portfolio project that impresses employers
- Work pace that prepares you for any tech job

## ðŸŽ­ **Mentorship Style:**

I'll match industry intensity:

- **Direct feedback** (like real code reviews)
- **High expectations** (production quality)
- **Quick response** to blockers
- **Real deadlines** with consequences

**Are you ready for this level of intensity? This is exactly how we build production systems under tight deadlines.**

**If yes, let's start RIGHT NOW with Task 1 - but with the expectation that you complete it in the next 2-3 hours, not over several days.**

**Ready to work like a professional developer?** ðŸš€
